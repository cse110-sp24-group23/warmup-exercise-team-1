# User Story

## Name:

Low-vision Lewis

## Wants/needs:

Sentiment widget which is accessible and fully functional solely through keyboard shortcuts, with alternative text to be read by his computer.

## Doesn't want/need:

Complicated aesthetics that hinder the ability for him to use his keyboard to navigate through the options.

## Reflection in app:

Widget allows for navigation for blind and low vision users through leveraging built in tab and arrow navigation from the radio input element, with alternative tags for text-to-speech output for blind and low vision users.
