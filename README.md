## Motivation and Background

Our goal was to create a simple solution to allow users to convey their sentiment of their browsing experience for a particular site. With this and other design choices in mind, some of our features include:

-   **Clear** Selection Identification
-   Keyboard **Accessibility**
-   **Dependency-free** and lightweight html/css/js

Here is the [Miro page](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKQvp0qs=/) where we planned everything.
